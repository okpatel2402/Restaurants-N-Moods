# Restaurants-N-Moods
This project aims to develop a mood-based restaurant recommender system using data from Zomato for the city of Indore. The recommender suggests restaurants based on the user's mood, budget, and location. The project involves data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and sentiment analysis to enhance the recommendation model.
